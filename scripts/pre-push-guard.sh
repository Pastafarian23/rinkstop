# Pre-push guard for RinkStop
# Runs 5 gates before any push to origin. If any gate fails, the script exits
# non-zero and the push is blocked. Designed to catch the class of bugs that
# caused the 2026-08-11 prod 500: dynamic-segment collisions in Next.js routes.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/pre-push-guard.sh [branch-name]
# Exit: 0 if all gates pass, 1 otherwise.
#
# Note: Removed Gate 4 (full pnpm build) on 2026-09-17 per Arnel's approval.
# The build was taking 146-163s on every push and duplicating work Vercel
# already does on every push (Vercel blocks failed deploys anyway).
# TypeScript errors are still caught by Gate 3. Route collisions are caught
# by Gate 4 (now). If a new bug class emerges that needs full build
# verification, add it as a targeted gate rather than re-adding the full build.

# The original version of this gate checked across all parents at the same
# depth, which flagged every legitimate shared bracket name as a collision
# and made every push fail. Fixed 2026-08-11.

# Gate 5: Supabase column audit for team_workspaces.

# (city / country / logo_url) against `team_workspaces`, whose columns were
# renamed to home_city / home_country / avatar_url during the workspace
# migration. PostgREST returns 42703 ("column does not exist"), and the
# fail-safe wrappers turned that into an EMPTY result set — the public claim
# page reported "No teams found" for a team that was live in the DB.
# tsc cannot catch this (the Supabase client is untyped), and HTTP 200 proves
# nothing. Only a schema-vs-code diff catches it.
